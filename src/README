LNS3D: 3D unsteady compressible, linearized Navier--Stokes code 

To compile on Unix systems type:  make

6-25-98

I have brought this up-to-date (almost) with the SSD version on the Cray C90.
Routines that have not been fully updated will generate an error upon entry.

These include:

impdrv3d.f90

7-24-98:  Changed module names stuff -> global

==============================================================================
12-18-00

I have switched almost all of the routines to (ndof,i,j) ordering.

Routines that still need attention:

traces.f90
wallbc.f90
imprk.f90
lele & poinsoit BC's

The "perl" directory contains Perl scripts that helped to quickly change the
data-structures throughout the code.

==============================================================================
12-19-00

1) Updated module structure
1.1) Fixed bugs in rkbc and Reimann
2) Need to change the way metrics are stored
3) Need to update traces.f90 and wallbc.f90
4) Need to update grad.f90 and grad2.f90 with versions that support full
   symmetry conditions.
